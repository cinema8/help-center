### Incorrect email or password

- Make sure you’re using the correct email address linked to your Cinema8 account.  
- Passwords are case-sensitive — check for capitalization issues.  
- Try logging in using a different browser or incognito/private mode.

---

### Account temporarily locked

If you've entered the wrong password multiple times, your account may be locked for security reasons.  
Wait **10–15 minutes**, then try again.  
If it still doesn’t work, try resetting your password.

### Issues with social logins (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn)

- Make sure you’re logging in with the correct social account.  
- If you've recently changed your social media password, log out and try again.  
- Alternatively, log in with your email and reconnect your social account under **Settings > Linked Accounts**.

---

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) isn’t working

- Check your email or mobile device for the 2FA code.  
- Ensure email notifications are enabled.  
- If you’ve lost access to 2FA, contact **Cinema8 Support** to reset account security.

### Browser-related issues

- Clear your browser’s **cache and cookies**.  
- Try a different browser: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari.  
- Disable any browser extensions that might block the login page.

---

### Server or connectivity problems

- Ensure your **internet connection** is stable.  
- Check **Cinema8’s status page** or **social media** channels for potential server outages.
