# How to Create and Edit Users in Cinema8

Cinema8 allows you to manage user accounts, invite team members, and assign security roles efficiently. Here's how you can create and edit users in the platform.

<Steps>

### Access user management  
Log in to your Cinema8 account and navigate to the **Interaction Designer**. From the left-hand menu, expand the **More** section and click on **User Management**.

### Creating a new user  
Click the **+ New User** button in the **User List** tab. In the pop-up:

- Enter the email address of the user.  
- Select their security role (e.g., Admin or Viewer).  
- Press **Invite**. The user will receive an email invitation to join your Cinema8 account.

### Managing pending invitations  
Check the **Pending Invitations** section to monitor sent invites. You can cancel an invitation by clicking the trash icon under **Actions** if needed.

### Editing existing users  
In the **User List** tab, locate the user you want to edit by using the search fields (e.g., name, email).  
Click the **Edit** icon next to their name. Update their details or change their security role. Save the changes.

### Assigning and managing roles  
Go to the **Security Roles** tab within the **User Management** section. Here, you can:

- Create new roles with custom permissions.  
- Modify existing roles by adjusting access rights.

### Configuring security permissions  
Use the **Security Permissions** tab to define granular access controls, ensuring users have appropriate permissions for your projects.
