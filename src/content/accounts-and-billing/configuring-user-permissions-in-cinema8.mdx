# Configuring User Permissions in Cinema8

Cinema8 allows you to create and manage user permissions with ease, offering fine-grained control over what actions different roles can perform. Here’s how to configure user permissions:

## Accessing User Permissions

Navigate to the **User Management** section by clicking **More > User Management** in the left-side menu.  
Switch to the **Security Permissions** tab.

## Viewing Existing Permissions

In the **Security Permissions** tab, you will see a list of permissions with details like:

- **ID**  
- **Name**  
- **Description**  
- **Status** (Active or Inactive)

Each permission defines a specific action that users with the corresponding role can perform (e.g., managing projects, creating story flows).

## Creating a New Permission

- Click **+ New Permission**  
- Enter a unique **Name** for the permission  
- Add a **Description** for clarity  
- Set the **Status** to "Active"  
- Click **Save** to create the permission

## Assigning Permissions to Roles

To apply permissions to a role:

- Go to the **Security Roles** tab  
- Select an existing role or click **+ New Role** to create a new one  
- Enter a **Name** for the role  
- In the **Security Permissions** dropdown, select the relevant permissions  
- Click **Create** to save the role

## Editing or Deleting Permissions

- **Edit Permissions:** Use the pencil icon in the **Actions** column to modify an existing permission  
- **Delete Permissions:** Use the trash icon to remove a permission if no longer needed

## Best Practices for Permission Management

- Assign permissions based on job functions to maintain system security and efficiency  
- Review permissions periodically to ensure they align with your organization’s needs  
- Use descriptive names and clear descriptions for roles and permissions to avoid confusion
