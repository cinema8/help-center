What the user need when the user prepare a video quiz is perhaps to show your viewers their total score. Let's start with the first question.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Add the First Question

Add a **Single Select Question** to the video timeline. Write the question and answers. Click the settings button at the right of the correct answer.

In the **Set Variable** area:

- Label: `score`
- Value: `10`

This means when the viewer selects the correct answer, they earn 10 points. After completing the settings, click **Save**.

### Step 2: Add the Second Question

Open the settings for the correct answer, just like before. In the **Set Variable** area:

- Label: `score`
- Value: `${score} + 10`

This increases the existing score by 10 points when answered correctly. Click **Save**.

### Step 3: Add More Questions

Repeat the same steps for each additional question. Continue using the `${score} + 10` format to accumulate the score progressively.

### Step 4: Display the Total Score

At the end of the video, drag and drop the **HTML** widget from the **Elements Panel** onto the timeline.

In the HTML content editor:

- Type your message, for example: `Your Total Score:`
- Click the **Dynamic Text** button.
- Select the variable `score` from the list.
- Click **Save**.
