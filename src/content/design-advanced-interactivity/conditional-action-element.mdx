# Conditional Action Element

## How to Use the Conditional Action Tool to Trigger Actions Based on User Interactions

With the Conditional Action tool, you can store a mouse click or the answer to a question within the video. Later, you can trigger actions based on the data you have stored in memory.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Add a Question

Add a question to your video.

### Step 2: Set Variables for Answers

Click the **"New York"** button and add a new **"On Click"** action from the Properties panel.  
Choose **"Set Variable"**, then:

- **Key:** `choice`  
- **Value:** `false`

<Callout type="info">
ðŸ’¡ **Note:** When "Allow Multiple Execution" is checked, the variable can be changed multiple times. If unchecked, it only sets once.
</Callout>

Repeat this for the **"Washington"** option with:

- **Key:** `choice`  
- **Value:** `true`

Now:
- Selecting **New York** sets `choice = false`
- Selecting **Washington** sets `choice = true`

### Step 3: Add the Conditional Action Element

Drag the **Conditional Action** tool from the element list and drop it onto the layer.

### Step 4: Build the Query

Click **Add Condition** to define a query that checks the variable value.

In the panel:

- Select variable: `choice`
- Operator: `equals`
- Value: `true`

### Step 5: Add the Response Action

Add a feedback element like an **Image** or **Text** block that shows when the answer is correct.

The viewer will see the feedback **only if `choice = true`**.

### Step 6: Final Configuration

Click the **Conditional Action** element again to configure the behavior.

![Re-select Conditional Element](/screenshot/advanced-interactivity/conditional-action-9.webp)

Choose the **action** (e.g., `Set Visible`) and link it to the **feedback element**.

</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
ðŸ’¡ **Note:** The Conditional Action tool checks its condition throughout its **startâ€“end time range**. It doesnâ€™t just trigger once.
</Callout>

You can also add another Conditional Action for when `choice = false` to display a different message or take another action.
