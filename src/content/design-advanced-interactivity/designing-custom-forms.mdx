## How to Add and Customize Forms in Your Interactive Videos

Have you ever wanted to add a form to your videos? Perhaps you've needed to gather opinions for marketing studies, collect leads for sales, or create surveys for various purposes. Cinema8 allows you to integrate a variety of contact and information forms, survey forms, or custom forms at any point in your video.

There are two options for adding forms in Cinema8.
 

One option is to display forms **before the video starts**. These are called [Introduction Forms](/design-advanced-interactivity/how-to-add-questions-on-video).

You can require that fields be filled out and even **prevent the viewer from proceeding** without completing the form. This type of form includes fields like name, surname, email, and a terms & conditions acknowledgment.

Alternatively, you can **embed forms anywhere inside your video timeline** using Cinema8â€™s built-in form tools. Available elements include:

- Form Header  
- Paragraph  
- Text Field  
- Number  
- Text Area  
- Selection List  
- Radio Group  
- Checkbox Group  
- Date Field  
- Autocomplete Field


You can read more about designing these custom forms in the [Form Designer Element guide](/design-advanced-interactivity/customizing-form-elements-playing-with-styles).

All form submissions are automatically collected in the **Analytics** panel, where you can view detailed reports for each viewer interaction.
