# Customizing Form Elements, Playing with Styles

## How to Personalise Your Cinema8 Player and Interactive Video with Fonts and Colours

With Cinema8, you can easily customize your interactive forms and video player's colours to match your company's branding or personal style â€” making your video experience more engaging and professional.

Cinema8 also allows you to **embed fonts from Google Fonts** into your project. This helps you ensure all typography within your forms and videos aligns with your brand identity.

### Built-in vs Custom Fonts

Cinema8 provides a variety of default fonts for immediate use. However, if you need a unique or branded typeface, you can import any Google Font into your Cinema8 library and apply it throughout your interactive projects.

To learn how to embed Google Fonts into your project and apply them to form elements, refer to the [full guide here](/integrations-and-third-party-platforms/how-to-use-google-fonts-in-interactive-videos).
