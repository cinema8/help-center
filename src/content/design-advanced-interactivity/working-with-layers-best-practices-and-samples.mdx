# Working with Layers, Best Practices and Samples

## Understanding Layer Management for Interactive Video Projects

<Callout type="info">
Layers allow you to stack and organize multiple interactive elements in a timeline. This helps manage visibility, interactions, and layout in complex video designs.
</Callout>

Cinema8‚Äôs layer system works similarly to tools like After Effects, Figma, or Photoshop. You can place multiple elements at the same time interval and control their order visually.

### How Layers Work

Think of layers as transparent sheets stacked vertically. Elements on higher layers appear **above** those on lower layers. If two elements overlap, the one in the top layer will be visible.

> **Best practice:** Use separate layers for buttons, overlays, and persistent navigation to avoid confusion and enable easy control.

## Managing Layers in the Timeline

In Cinema8 Creative Studio, layers are located on the **left of the video timeline**.

### Key Layer Actions

| Action                | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Add Layer**          | Click the ‚ûï icon to insert a new layer under the last one. |
| **Reorder Layers**     | Use the up/down arrows to move a layer up or down. |
| **Rename Layer**       | Click the pencil/edit icon next to the layer name. |
| **Delete Layer**       | Click the trash icon. This action is **permanent**. |
| **Hide Layer**         | Use the üëÅ eye icon to temporarily hide that layer's content in the editor. |

<Callout type="warning">
If you delete a layer, all its elements will be removed permanently. Always double-check before deletion.
</Callout>

## Tips for Complex Projects

When you're working with multiple elements, things can get messy. Here‚Äôs how to keep control:

- Use descriptive names for each layer (e.g., "Buttons", "Overlay Text", "Navigation").
- Hide layers you‚Äôre not currently working on to declutter the view.
- Group related elements into a single layer when they should appear/disappear together.

## Summary

Layers in Cinema8 are powerful tools for structuring and refining interactive video experiences. Mastering them allows you to:

- Stack and organize complex scenes
- Control element visibility and timing precisely
- Maintain cleaner, scalable project files
