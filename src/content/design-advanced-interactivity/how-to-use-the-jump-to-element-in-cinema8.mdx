# How to Use the Jump To Element in Cinema8

## Creating Seamless Transitions Between Video Moments

The **Jump To** element allows you to skip to a specific point in the same video or to another project entirely. This is useful for creating branching scenarios, skipping intros, or fast-forwarding based on user input.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Add the Element

Drag and drop the **Jump To** element from the **Elements** list onto the timeline.
