# An introduction to 360-degree videos

## Discover the immersive world of 360-degree video content

360-degree videos are redefining how we experience video content, offering a fully immersive, interactive view of an environment. Unlike traditional videos that only show a single angle, 360-degree videos let viewers look in any direction, giving them the freedom to explore as if they’re truly there.

360-degree content comes in two formats: photography and video. 360-degree photography captures a single, static image that viewers can explore from any angle, making it ideal for showcasing spaces like real estate or landscapes. 360-degree video, on the other hand, adds movement, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in a dynamic, unfolding scene. Both formats let your audience look around, but video provides a more engaging, life-like experience with motion and sound.

### How does 360-degree video work?

Creating a 360-degree video involves capturing every angle of a scene and seamlessly combining it into a single, immersive experience.

Here’s how it’s done:

1. **Capturing the scene:** Specialized 360-degree cameras use multiple lenses to record footage from every direction. Some advanced models feature a single multi-lens camera, while others rely on a setup of several cameras working together.

2. **Stitching the footage:** The separate recordings are processed and combined using software to create a smooth, spherical view. This stitching process ensures there are no visible seams where the footage connects.

3. **Making it interactive:** Take your 360-degree videos to the next level by adding interactive elements. With features like clickable hotspots, branching pathways, and AR/VR integrations, you can create immersive, life-like experiences that let viewers engage with your content in exciting, dynamic ways.
