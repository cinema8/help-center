# How to Make Branching Video with Different Finals

## Building Multi-Outcome Experiences with Conditional Logic

Imagine having multiple questions in your interactive video and several final scenes shaped by the choices made by viewers. How would you manage this situation?

This guide walks you through an example where a specific combination of answers leads to a unique final video segment.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Create the Project  
After logging into Cinema8 Creative Studio, create your interactive project and open the editor.

### Step 2: Add Question 1 (00:00:05.000)  
- Insert a **Single Select Question** at the 5-second mark.  
- Set variables for each option:
  - First Option → `question1 = a`
  - Second Option → `question1 = b`
  - Third Option → `question1 = c`
- Click **Save** after assigning values.

### Step 3: Add Question 2 (00:00:10.000)  
- Copy the question element to 10 seconds.  
- Configure as:
  - First Option → `question2 = a`
  - Second Option → `question2 = b`
  - Third Option → `question2 = c`

### Step 4: Add Question 3 (00:00:15.000)  
- Copy the question element again to 15 seconds.  
- Set variable values:
  - First Option → `question3 = a`
  - Second Option → `question3 = b`
  - Third Option → `question3 = c`

### Step 5: Add Conditional Widget  
- Add a **Conditional Action** widget between 00:00:17.000 – 00:00:18.000.  
- Configure it to check for all 3 variable values:
  - `question1 = a`
  - `question2 = c`
  - `question3 = b`
- Click **Save** after adding the conditions.

### Step 6: Define the Outcome  
- In the **Conditional Action Properties**, set the action as:
  - **Action Type**: "Jump in This Project"  
  - **Jump To Time**: `00:01:00.000` (start of Final 2)

### Step 7: Add Other Final Paths  
- Repeat Steps 5–6 for additional combinations that lead to different final outcomes.  
- Place each conditional action in the same decision window (`00:00:17.000 – 00:00:18.000`).

### Step 8: Pause the Video After Final  
- To prevent viewers from continuing after a final, insert an **Action** widget at the end of Final 2.  
- Set the action to "Pause Video"  
- Configure time: `00:01:25.000 – 00:01:26.000`  
- Save changes.

</Steps>

By strategically placing questions, setting variables, and using conditional logic, you can build complex branching experiences with distinct endings tailored to viewer decisions.
