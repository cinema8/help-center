# How to Earn Badges by Viewers' Choice w/Variables

## A step-by-step guide to implementing gamification with badge rewards in your interactive videos

Using badges — one of the most effective gamification elements — can significantly boost viewer engagement by rewarding participation. For example, in a video with three questions, if a viewer answers at least two correctly, they can earn a badge like "Honesty." Here's how to implement this:

<Steps>

### Step 1: Add the Badge Image
Ensure your badge image is stored in your image library. Add it to the timeline using the **Image** widget and position it where you want the badge to appear. Adjust its display duration and **disable the "Visible" setting** in the Properties panel.

### Step 2: Add the First Question and Initialize Score
Add a **Single Select Question** to your video. In the correct option’s settings, define a variable called `score`. Type:

```text
score = 1
```

in the **Set Variable** section and save.

### Step 3: Add the Second Question and Increment Score
Add a second question. In the correct option’s settings, increment the score variable by using:

```text
score = ${score} + 1
```

and save.

### Step 4: Add the Third Question and Continue Tracking Score
Repeat the same for the third question. Use the same score update logic to track correct answers.

### Step 5: Set a Condition for Badge Visibility
Add a **Conditional** widget to check if the viewer earned enough points. Set the condition:

```text
score = 2
```

This ensures the badge appears only if two or more correct answers were given.

### Step 6: Position the Conditional Action Widget
Place the **Conditional Action** widget right after the second or third question (depending on when you want the badge to appear).

### Step 7: Set the Badge Display Action
In the Conditional Action Properties, choose **Set Visible** as the action, and select the badge image from the **Target Tracklist**. Save the settings.

### Step 8: Copy Conditions if Needed
If you want to check the condition multiple times, copy the Conditional Action widget to other points in the video timeline where it makes sense to evaluate the badge display.
