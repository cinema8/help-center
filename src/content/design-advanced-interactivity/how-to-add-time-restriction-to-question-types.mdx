<Callout type="info">
Adding time restrictions enhances interactivity and creates game-like pressure in learning or quiz scenarios.

## Using the Countdown Element with Questions

<Steps>

### Step 1: Add a Question to the Timeline

Begin by adding any question type (e.g., multiple choice, fill in the blank) to your video timeline.

### Step 2: Add the Countdown Widget

Drag and drop the **Countdown** element from the **Elements** panel to the same time interval as the question.

![Countdown Timer](/screenshot/questions/countdown-1.webp)

This widget controls how long a viewer has to respond.

### Step 3: Configure General Settings

Use the Countdown’s **Properties Panel** to:

- Set the countdown duration (e.g., 5 seconds)
- Style the countdown appearance if needed

### Step 4: Define "On Complete" Behavior

Select an **On Complete** action — this will trigger if the viewer fails to respond within the countdown period.

Common use cases:

- **Jump in This Project**  
  Automatically skip to another part of the video.

- **Set Visible + Play Audio**  
  Trigger a voice alert such as:  
  _"Your time is up, please make a choice."_  
  Set the audio element as **invisible**, then choose **Play Audio** in Countdown’s **On Complete** settings.

- **Set Variable**  
  Track if the viewer answered in time.  
  You can use this later to display a summary or score.
