# Understanding Project-Specific Data

Cinema8 allows you to track and analyse data specific to individual projects, providing detailed insights into how your videos and interactive elements perform. This level of granularity helps you optimise content based on viewer behaviour, engagement, and overall effectiveness.

## Accessing Project-Specific Data

* **Navigate to Advanced Analytics**
  Open the Cinema8 dashboard and click on **Analytics** in the left-hand menu. Select **Advanced Analytics** and choose the project or video you want to analyse.

* **Filter Your Data**
  Use filters to narrow down insights by specific videos, date ranges, or audience segments.

## Key Metrics for Project-Specific Analysis

* **Review Engagement Heat Maps**
  Navigate to the **Heat Map** tab to see which parts of the video engaged viewers the most. Identify drop-off points and refine content accordingly.

* **Check Track Interactions**
  Open the **Tracks** tab to monitor how viewers interacted with individual elements like forms, buttons, or quizzes.

* **Download Detailed Reports**
  Use the **Download Questions Report** or **Download Track List Report** options to save specific data for deeper analysis.

## Using Project-Specific Data to Optimise Videos

* **Enhance Underperforming Segments**
  Use heat maps to identify where viewers lose interest and make those sections more engaging.

* **Refine Interactive Elements**
  Analyse interactions with hotspots, buttons, or forms to improve their placement or design.

* **Improve Learning Outcomes**
  For e-learning projects, monitor quiz responses to identify areas where viewers need more support.

* **Tailor Content for Devices**
  Use device and browser data to ensure your videos are optimised for your audience's preferred platforms.
