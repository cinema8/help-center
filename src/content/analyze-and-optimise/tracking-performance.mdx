# Tracking Performance

Cinema8 makes it easy to monitor the effectiveness of your interactive videos through a range of detailed performance analytics. By analysing viewer engagement and behaviour, you can identify what works, what doesn’t, and how to improve future content.

## How to Access Video Performance Analytics

To begin tracking performance:

- Open the **Cinema8 Dashboard**
- Navigate to **Analytics** in the main menu
- Choose from:
  - **Overview Analytics** for top-level insights across all projects
  - **Advanced Analytics** for interaction-level breakdowns
  - **A/B Testing** to compare different video versions

Then, select the video you want to analyse using the dropdown menu.

## Understanding Viewer Behaviour with Heat Maps

Cinema8's heat maps visually highlight which parts of your video receive the most attention:

- **Green segments** represent areas with high engagement and replay
- **Red segments** indicate sections that viewers skip or drop off

Use this insight to adjust pacing, content length, or interactivity placement.

## Tracking Specific Interactions

From **Advanced Analytics**, go to the **Tracks** tab to review:

- **Clickable Areas** – See which buttons or hotspots receive the most clicks
- **Quizzes & Forms** – Analyse viewer responses, completion rates, and accuracy
- **Media Elements** – Monitor interaction with embedded widgets, audio, and images

You can also export this data using the **Download Questions Report** or **Download Track List Report** for further review or stakeholder sharing.

## Tips for Better Performance Tracking

- **Monitor device and browser stats** to ensure content compatibility
- **Review location-based data** to localise or adapt videos for regional audiences
- **Use A/B test results** to guide content iterations
- **Combine heat map insights** with engagement metrics to fine-tune both creative and UX aspects

By consistently analysing these metrics, you can ensure your Cinema8 videos evolve in line with your audience's expectations and behaviours.
