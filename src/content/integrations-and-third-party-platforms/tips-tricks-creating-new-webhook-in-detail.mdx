# Creating a New Webhook

<Callout type="info">
Use webhooks to connect Cinema8 interactions with external systems by sending real-time data.
</Callout>

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Name

Give your webhook a meaningful name. This helps identify its purpose, especially if you're managing multiple webhooks.

### 2. URL

Enter the endpoint where data should be sent. Make sure it's a valid and secure URL that can handle POST requests.

### 3. Headers

You can add custom headers to the request. This is useful for including tokens or authentication credentials to securely validate requests on your server.

### 4. Additional Settings

- **Execute Synchronously**:  
  If enabled, the video will pause until the webhook call is completed. Use this for mission-critical events that must finish before playback continues.

- **Post User Interactions**:  
  Choose specific interactive elements (like buttons or forms) that should trigger data to be sent via the webhook.

<Callout type="important">
For best results, test your webhook endpoint before enabling synchronous execution.
</Callout>
