# Creating New Webhook in Detail

<Callout type="info">
Use Cinema8's webhook setup to exchange real-time data with your backend systems securely and efficiently.
</Callout>

The **"Create New Webhook"** screen in Cinema8 allows you to set up a webhook to connect and exchange data with your own systems. By completing the required fields, you can fully configure a webhook for your interactive video projects.

## Setting Up a New Webhook

**1. Name**  
Enter a unique name for the webhook in the **Name** field.

**2. URL**  
Specify the webhook endpoint in the **URL** field, where Cinema8 will send data.

**3. Add Headers**  
Use the **Add Headers To Request** section to define any custom headers and values. This is essential for securing the webhook connection, allowing you to pass tokens or credentials during the interaction.

## Webhook Settings

**Execute Synchronously**  
Enable this option if you want the video to pause until the webhook completes execution. This is useful for scenarios requiring ordered data processing.

**Post User Interactions**  
Choose which interactive elements in your video will send data through the webhook.

<Callout type="important">
These settings ensure your webhook is securely and correctly configured for real-time video interaction workflows.
