# Reporting with API

<Callout type="info">
Use the Reporting API to retrieve user-generated data and generate flexible, real-time insights from your Cinema8 videos.
</Callout>

## Overview

The **Reporting API** provides a standardized way for web applications to generate and retrieve reports based on platform features such as:

- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Feature Policy
- Feature deprecation reports

This ensures consistent access to structured, trackable data.

## Key Benefits

- **Access to Historical and Live Data**  
  Generate reports using both real-time and historical data snapshots, helping you identify trends and monitor changes over time.

- **No Manual Updates Required**  
  Once connected, reporting tools can pull the latest data automatically — no manual copy-pasting required.

- **Tool-Agnostic Integration**  
  The API is compatible with third-party tools and dashboards. You don’t need to be a developer to use it; simply connect with your preferred visualization tool.

- **Custom Queries and Filters**  
  Create specific queries that return exactly the data you want. Filter or expand result sets based on your metrics.

- **Secure Access**  
  Data access is protected with API Key authentication, ensuring secure reporting workflows.

## Cinema8 Implementation

Cinema8’s **Reporting API** acts as a unified data collection layer. You can use it to extract user interaction data directly from videos, supporting analytics, performance tracking, and business intelligence initiatives.
