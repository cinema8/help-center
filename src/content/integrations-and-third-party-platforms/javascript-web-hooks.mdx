# JavaScript Webhooks

<Callout type="info">
Use JavaScript webhooks to trigger your own business logic directly from video interactions.
</Callout>

Cinema8 allows you to inject custom JavaScript code into your interactive videos using the **Execute Custom Callback** action. This is a powerful way to connect user actions within the video to external logic in your application.

## How It Works

### 1. Trigger a Callback from Video Elements

You can attach the **Execute Custom Callback** action to various elements inside the Cinema8 Creative Studio:

- Image elements with an `onClick` action
- Clickable Area components
- Conditional Actions
- Timeline-based Action elements

When any of these elements are triggered during playback, your custom JavaScript callback will be executed in the embedding context.

### 2. Handle the Callback in Your JavaScript

Use the Cinema8 JavaScript API to listen for the callback. Here’s an example of how to catch it:

```js filename="example.js"
var ivideo = new IVideo('#video', {
  id: '4JyYR9JQ',
  autoplay: false,
  width: 854,
  height: 480,
  onready: function() {},
  onprogress: function() {},
  onplay: function() {},
  onpause: function() {},
  onend: function() {},
  oncustomcallback: function(param) {
    // This is where your logic runs
    console.log(param);
  }
});
