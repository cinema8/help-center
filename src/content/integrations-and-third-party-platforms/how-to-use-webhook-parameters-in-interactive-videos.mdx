# How to Use Webhook Parameters in Interactive Videos

<Callout type="info">
Cinema8 allows you to use webhook data to personalize your video by accessing object values such as user information.
</Callout>

## Accessing Webhook Object Data

Let’s say the webhook sends the following object:

```json filename="webhook-payload.json"
{
  "score": 85,
  "user": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "userName": "john.doe"
  }
}
```

You can extract and display values like `firstName`, `lastName`, and `userName` directly in the video using the **HTML element**.

First, add the HTML element to your video.  
[Learn how to add HTML elements →](/engage-and-monetise/html-element)

Then insert the appropriate display code inside the element to show the webhook parameters.

Preview the video to see the dynamic values appear.

## Using Conditional Logic with Webhook Parameters

To take it further, you can conditionally control elements based on webhook values.

1. Add a **Conditional Action** element to your video.  
   [Learn how to add conditional actions →](/design-advanced-interactivity/conditional-action-element)

2. In the condition configuration, add:

```
user.username = john.doe
```

> `user` refers to the object from the webhook payload, and `username` is the field you’re matching.

<Callout type="important">
This conditional logic will only trigger if the webhook data has been successfully received by the video.
</Callout>
