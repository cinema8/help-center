# Cinema8 Support for oEmbed and Player.js

## Seamless Integration of Cinema8 Interactive Videos Across Platforms

**oEmbed** is an open format that enables embedding a URL's representation on third-party sites. With oEmbed, a website can display embedded content—such as photos or videos—when a user posts a link to that resource without having to parse or render the content manually.

<Callout type="info">
Cinema8 supports the oEmbed specification, allowing its videos to be embedded into platforms that use rich-text or WYSIWYG editors supporting oEmbed endpoints.
</Callout>

### How oEmbed Works

An *oEmbed* exchange takes place between:

- **Consumer:** A platform or website embedding content (e.g., Medium, WordPress).
- **Provider:** Cinema8, responding with metadata like the embed HTML.

This makes it easier for platforms to display video previews without extra coding or API parsing.

## Player.js Compatibility

**Player.js** is a lightweight JavaScript API standard that enables developers to control media (play, pause, volume, etc.) inside embedded iframes using postMessage. It is supported by many video platforms.

<Callout type="info">
Cinema8 players are compatible with the Player.js API, allowing you to control embedded interactive videos programmatically via iframe.
</Callout>

Supported methods include:

- `play()`
- `pause()`
- `getCurrentTime()`
- `setCurrentTime(seconds)`
- `getDuration()`
- `mute()` / `unmute()`

This allows tight integration into complex frontend frameworks and LMS platforms.

## Practical Use Cases

- Embedding Cinema8 videos into content platforms (e.g., **Medium**, **Kickstarter**, **Notion**) that support oEmbed URLs.
- Using **CKEditor**, **TinyMCE**, or other HTML editors with oEmbed preview capabilities.
- Integrating Player.js into a custom video experience to monitor progress or trigger actions programmatically.

<Callout type="important">
Cinema8's oEmbed and Player.js support improves compatibility across global content platforms while maintaining full interactivity and analytics.
