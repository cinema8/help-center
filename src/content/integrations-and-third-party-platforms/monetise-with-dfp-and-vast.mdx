## What is DFP (Google Ad Manager)?

Google Ad Manager (formerly DoubleClick for Publishers) is a platform designed to manage the delivery of ads across websites. It enables the distribution of both video ads and banner ads via embedded code.

## What is VAST?

VAST (Video Ad Serving Template) is a standard that enables communication between video ad servers and video players. It allows ads to be delivered via code across different platforms.

DFP and VAST make it possible to add video and banner advertisements at any point in your content. With Cinema8’s **Advertising element**, you can integrate these ads into your interactive videos and increase monetization opportunities.

## Key Features

- **Flexible Placement**  
  Insert ads at any moment in the video timeline, between videos, or based on user interactions.

- **Conditional Display**  
  For example, show an ad only if a user answers 1 or 2 questions incorrectly. Alternatively, display the ad at the end if all answers are correct.

- **Mandatory Watch Time**  
  Set a required viewing duration for each ad, optimizing completion rates and ad revenue.

- **Google Ad Manager Integration**  
  Easily connect your Google Ad Manager account with Cinema8.
