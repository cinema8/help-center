# Ads in Your Interactive Videos

<Callout type="info">
Cinema8 supports integration with Google Ad Manager (DFP) and VAST to deliver monetized ads in interactive video content.
</Callout>

Cinema8 allows you to monetize your interactive videos by embedding ad content such as banners or videos using **DFP (Google Ad Manager)** and **VAST (Video Ad Serving Template)**.

These tools enable targeted ad delivery during playback or between video segments and allow integration with third-party ad platforms.

## What Are DFP and VAST?

- **DFP (Google Ad Manager)**  
  Formerly known as DoubleClick for Publishers, DFP is a platform used to manage and deliver ads across websites and applications using code-based integration.

- **VAST (Video Ad Serving Template)**  
  VAST is an industry-standard protocol that enables video ads to be served across different platforms and devices using a unified code format.

## How to Use Ads in Cinema8 Videos

<Steps>

### Step 1: Add the Advertising Element

Use the **DoubleClick for Publishers** element in Cinema8 to configure the ad zone. You can embed either video or banner ads directly into your interactive project.

### Step 2: Define Ad Placement

Choose where ads should appear:
- At a specific time during playback
- Between two video segments
- Based on viewer interaction (e.g., answering questions)

### Step 3: Set Conditional Logic (Optional)

Apply logic to control ad behavior.  
**Example:**  
Show an ad only if a viewer answers a quiz question incorrectly. If the answer is correct, delay the ad to the end of the video.

### Step 4: Set Mandatory Watch Time

Define how long the viewer must watch the ad before continuing the video. This helps maximize ad visibility and revenue.

### Step 5: Integrate Your DFP Account

Connect your **Google Ad Manager** account within Cinema8 to manage campaigns and reporting.
