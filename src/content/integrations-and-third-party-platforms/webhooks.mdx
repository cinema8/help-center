Webhooks are incredibly useful and a resource-light way to implement event reactions. A webhook (also known as a web callback or HTTP push API) enables applications to provide real-time information to other applications. With webhooks, data is transmitted immediately, so you receive it as soon as it's available.

In Cinema8, webhooks allow real-time data exchange between server applications and interactive videos. You can transfer data directly from your backend services into Cinema8 experiences — enabling personalized content, business logic integrations, and interactive feedback loops.
