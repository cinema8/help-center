# How to Use Server-Side Webhooks to Inject Custom Variables into Video

<Callout type="info">
Use server-side webhooks in Cinema8 to automatically send and receive data between your video content and any public API or backend system.
</Callout>

## Automatically Trigger Actions and Pass Data with Cinema8 Webhooks

Cinema8’s server-side webhooks allow you to respond to real-time events and inject data into videos dynamically. This eliminates the need for continuous polling and enables smooth integration with third-party systems.

You can use this integration to:
- Push data into a Cinema8 video from an external service
- Trigger actions in your system when a viewer interacts with your content
- Capture viewer responses or interactions and forward them to your API

## How It Works

<Steps>

### Step 1: Define a Rule-Based Webhook Action

Set up a webhook in Cinema8 using the **Webhook** integration feature. Define a rule that determines when the webhook should fire (e.g., on button click, form submission).

### Step 2: Configure the Target URL

Provide the **endpoint URL** that will receive the webhook request. This can be any public API or your server accepting POST requests.

### Step 3: Include Custom Parameters

Within the webhook setup, define the custom parameters or data fields you want to send (e.g., user ID, score, selection).

### Step 4: Handle the Data in Your Application

In your receiving system or API, handle the incoming request and respond accordingly — for example, by returning dynamic variables or confirming data receipt.

### Step 5: Use Returned Data in the Video

You can reference returned variables (e.g., `discountCode`, `userName`, etc.) inside your Cinema8 video by assigning them to elements like HTML overlays or conditional actions.

</Steps>

<Callout type="important">
Cinema8 webhooks support structured and nested data. Make sure your endpoint returns JSON-formatted responses that match your video’s variable usage.
</Callout>
