# Using Webhooks in Interaction Design

Cinema8 Webhooks let you send or receive real-time data between your interactive videos and external systems. This allows you to personalize content, sync data, or trigger workflows based on viewer actions.

<Callout type="info">
A webhook (also known as a web callback or HTTP push API) is a method for one application to send data to another automatically when an event occurs. Cinema8 lets you trigger webhooks from within a video and optionally wait for a response before continuing playback.
</Callout>

## Creating a Webhook

<Steps>
### Step 1: Open the Webhook Panel

- Go to the Cinema8 **main menu**
- Click **Integrations**, then select **Webhooks**

### Step 2: Add a New Webhook

- Click **Add Webhook**
- Fill out the webhook configuration:
  - **Webhook Name**: Descriptive name
  - **Webhook URL**: Endpoint where data will be sent
  - **Header Name/Value** (optional): Used for authentication
  - **Wait for Response**: Pause video until webhook completes (optional)
  - **Include Previous Interactions**: Include past data in the payload (optional)
- Click **Save Settings**
</Steps>

## Adding the Webhook to a Video

<Steps>
### Step 1: Create or Open a Project

- Open an existing project or [create a new interactive video](/create-and-edit-videos/creating-your-first-video)

### Step 2: Prepare Dynamic Fields

- Decide which data fields (e.g., `discountCode`, `imageUrl`) your video will use

### Step 3: Embed Webhook Data in HTML Elements

- Add an HTML element to the video
- Use this syntax to render the data:
  - For discount code:  
    ```
    DiscountCode: ${context.discountCode}
    ```
  - For image:  
    ```html
    <img src="${context.imageUrl}" />
    ```

### Step 4: Create a Clickable Area

- Add a **Clickable Area** component to the timeline
- In the On Click settings, choose **Execute Webhook**
- Select the webhook you created (e.g., "Test Webhook")
</Steps>
