Switch to the **Responsive** tab in the embed dialog. Copy the responsive iframe code provided.

### Step 3: Insert Into Your Website

## Optimization Tips

- **Mobile-First Design**  
  Apply CSS rules that prioritize small screens and scale up gracefully.

- **Test Across Devices**  
  Always verify layout and interactivity on phones, tablets, and desktops.

- **Preserve Interactivity**  
  Cinema8’s hotspots, forms, and other interactive elements remain fully functional inside iframes.

## Embedding in Websites and Apps

- **For Websites**  
  Works with WordPress, Wix, and custom-built platforms. Add the iframe into any HTML block or editor.

- **For Mobile Apps**  
  Use a **WebView** or equivalent component to display the responsive iframe inside your native application.
