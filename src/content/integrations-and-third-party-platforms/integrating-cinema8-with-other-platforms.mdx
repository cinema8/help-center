# Integrating Cinema8 with Other Platforms

Cinema8 offers flexible integration capabilities that allow you to connect interactive video experiences with a wide range of third-party platforms, analytics tools, and learning management systems.

<Callout type="info">
Most integrations can be configured without coding using our sharing tools, SCORM exports, or visual widget editor. For advanced use cases, our JS and REST APIs provide full control.
</Callout>

## Ready-to-Use Integration Models

### Google Tag Manager (GTM)

Google Tag Manager allows you to manage analytics and conversion tracking without modifying code.

- Track user interactions like play, pause, and quiz completions
- Push events to GTM dataLayer
- Add marketing or retargeting tags

<Callout type="important">
You can inject GTM scripts in the player container or configure it through your platform where the video is embedded.
</Callout>

### Google Fonts

### DFP and VAST Ad Integrations

Cinema8 can communicate with ad servers using:

- Google DFP (DoubleClick)
- VAST-compliant video ad servers

This allows you to run pre-roll, mid-roll, or overlay ads inside your interactive videos.

- Brightcove
- Kaltura
- AWS MediaConvert or CloudFront
- Other CDNs or video providers

### SCORM Integration

- **SCORM 1.2**
- **SCORM 2004 (all editions)**

This allows LMS platforms like Akademi.net, Moodle, Blackboard, or Canvas to track:

- Watch completion
- Quiz responses

<Callout type="info">
SCORM exports include built-in data tracking and are compatible with most SCORM-compliant LMS platforms.

## Developer-Focused Integrations

### JavaScript API

Use the Cinema8 JavaScript API to control video behavior, track events, or integrate with your frontend logic.

```js filename="example.js"
c8PlayerApi.on("play", () => {
  console.log("Video started");
});

c8PlayerApi.setVariable('score', 100);
