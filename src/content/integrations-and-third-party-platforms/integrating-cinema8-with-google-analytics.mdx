# Integrating Cinema8 with Google Analytics

Cinema8 supports Google Analytics integration through **Google Tag Manager (GTM)**. You can assign a GTM ID to each custom player configuration, which injects GTM into the video player embed. This allows you to track video impressions and behavior using your GA dashboard.

<Callout type="info">
Cinema8 currently supports Google Analytics integration via Google Tag Manager only. You can manage GTM per-player configuration inside the Cinema8 dashboard under Customisation → Player Themes.
</Callout>

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
### Step 1: Create or locate a GTM container

- Go to https://tagmanager.google.com
- Create a container or use an existing one
- Copy your container ID (e.g., `GTM-XXXXXXX`)

### Step 2: Add GTM ID to Cinema8 Player Theme

- Log into your **Cinema8 dashboard**
- Navigate to **Customisation → Player Themes**
- Select or create a player configuration
- Paste your GTM ID into the **Google Tag Manager** field
- Save your player settings

### Step 3: Use the player in your project

- Embed your interactive video using the configured player
- GTM will automatically be injected into the iframe
</Steps>

## Optional: Trigger custom events with GTM

You can push custom video events (like play or pause) using the Widget API.

```js filename="widget.js"
c8PlayerApi.on('play', () => {
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []
  dataLayer.push({
    event: 'video_play',
    videoId: c8PlayerApi.getVideoId?.()
  })
})
```

<Callout type="important">
To implement full tracking, you must configure GTM Tags, Triggers, and Variables for these events in your GTM workspace. Cinema8 does not push analytics events by default.
