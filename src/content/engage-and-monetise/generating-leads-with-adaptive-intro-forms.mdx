# Generating Leads with Adaptive Intro Forms

Adaptive intro forms help convert your video content into a lead-generation engine. By collecting viewer informationâ€”such as names, emails, or qualifying responsesâ€”at key moments in your video, you can grow your audience and feed data directly into your CRM.

You can add lead forms either at the start of your video using the **Introduction Element**, or place them anywhere using the **Widget Element**.

---

## Option 1: Introduction Form (At Video Start)

Use this method when you want to gate your video or qualify viewers before the main content begins.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Open Your Project in Creative Studio

- Log into **Cinema8** and open the video you want to edit.

### Step 2: Add the Introduction Element

- From the **Elements Panel**, drag the **Introduction Form** to the start of your timeline.

### Step 3: Configure Fields

- Select which fields to include:
  - Name
  - Surname
  - Email
  - Intro (open-ended field)
  - Terms & Conditions (checkbox)
- Mark any required fields as needed.

### Step 4: Save and Preview

- Click **Save** to apply the changes.
- Use **Preview Mode** to confirm the form loads at the beginning of the video.

</Steps>

## Option 2: Widget Form (Anywhere in the Video)

If you prefer a more flexible placement, use the **Widget Element** to insert lead-gen forms at key engagement points.

<Steps>

### Step 1: Open the Elements Panel

- In Creative Studio, select the **Widget Element**.

### Step 2: Add the Form to the Timeline

- Drag and drop the widget where you want it to appear (e.g., after an intro or before a CTA).

### Step 3: Select a Lead Generation Template

- From the **Widget Library**, choose a **Lead Generation Form** layout.

### Step 4: Customize the Form

- Use the **Properties Panel** to set:
  - Field types (e.g., email, company, feedback)
  - Colors, fonts, and button styles
  - Post-submit actions (e.g., show message, redirect, continue video)

### Step 5: Save and Test

- Click **Save**, then preview your video to test form appearance and behavior.

</Steps>

## Best Practices for Lead Generation

<Callout type="info">
ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: Keep your forms short and place them when engagement is highestâ€”such as after value has been delivered, or before a strong CTA.
</Callout>

- **Limit required fields** â€“ Asking for too much too soon lowers completion.
- **Use clear, benefit-driven CTAs** â€“ Let users know what they get by submitting.
- **Test placements** â€“ Try showing the form at different timestamps to see what converts best.
