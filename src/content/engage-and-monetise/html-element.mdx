# HTML Element

The **HTML Element** in Cinema8 gives you the flexibility to display custom content such as formatted text, media, embedded widgets, and dynamic variables‚Äîdirectly in your videos. It‚Äôs perfect for adding personalized messages, gamified elements, and interactive feedback based on viewer behavior.

One powerful example: **rewarding viewers with a badge** when they achieve a specific score in a quiz.

## Use Case: Awarding a Badge After a Quiz

Let‚Äôs say you want to award the ‚ÄúHonesty Badge‚Äù if a viewer answers at least 2 out of 3 quiz questions correctly. Here‚Äôs how to do it step-by-step.

## How to Set Up an HTML-Based Gamified Badge

<Steps>

### Step 1: Add the HTML Element

- Open your project in **Cinema8 Creative Studio**.
- From the **Elements Panel**, drag the **HTML Element** onto the timeline where the badge message should appear.
- Give the element a clear name (e.g., `BadgeRewardDisplay`).

### Step 2: Enter Custom HTML Content

- Use the **HTML Editor** to enter custom content.
- You can include:
  - Text, links, or images
  - Dynamic variables like `{score}` or `{viewerName}`

### Step 3: Add the Badge Image (Hidden by Default)

- Upload the badge image to your **Image Library**.
- Drag the **Image Element** onto the timeline where you want the badge to appear.
- In the **Properties Panel**, uncheck the **Visible** box to keep it hidden initially.

### Step 4: Create Quiz Questions and Track Score

- Drag and drop a **Single Select Question** element for each question.
- For each correct answer, assign a variable update (e.g., `score = score + 1`).

### Step 5: Use Conditional Logic to Trigger the Badge

- Add a **Conditional Widget** after all questions are answered.
- In the **Properties Panel**, define the condition:  
  `If score >= 2, then Set Visible: Badge Image Element`
- This will make the badge appear when the condition is met.

### Step 6: Preview and Finalize

- Use the **Preview Mode** to test the interaction:
  - Do quiz questions score correctly?
  - Does the badge appear when expected?
- Save and publish once everything works smoothly.

</Steps>
