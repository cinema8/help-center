# Making Amazing Video Surveys with Hotspots

Surveys are an excellent way to gather insights, feedback, and engagement data from your audience. By embedding them directly into your videos using **hotspots**, you create a frictionless, interactive experienceâ€”keeping viewers engaged while collecting valuable responses in real time.

## Why Use Video Surveys?

- **Enhanced Engagement**  
  Viewers are more likely to participate when surveys are part of the video experience.

- **Real-Time Feedback**  
  Gather insights immediately after asking a questionâ€”without disrupting flow.

- **Higher Response Rates**  
  Integrated surveys avoid redirections, increasing participation.

## How to Create a Video Survey Using Hotspots

<Steps>

### Step 1: Plan Your Survey

- Define your **goals**: What kind of information are you looking to collect?
- Map out your **survey flow**: Decide which questions appear where in the video.
- Align your questions with the **contentâ€™s purpose** (e.g. feedback, segmentation, research).

### Step 2: Add Hotspots to Display Questions

- Open your project in **Cinema8 Creative Studio**.
- From the **Elements Panel**, drag the **Hotspot Element** onto the timeline.
- Choose the timing for each hotspot to appear during the video.

### Step 3: Customise the Hotspot

- Enter the **question text** or multiple-choice options for the viewer.
- Use the **Properties Panel** to style the hotspot:
  - Font, color, size, border, background
- Ensure your hotspot stands out visually but stays on-brand.

### Step 4: Track and Collect Responses

- Use **variables** to capture answers (e.g., `response = "A"` when a hotspot is clicked).
- Optionally, combine with a **Form Widget** to collect additional info like name or email.
- Set up logic or conditions to control what happens based on each answer.

### Step 5: Provide Feedback and Analyze Results

- Use a **Text** or **HTML Widget** to display confirmation or feedback based on viewer choices.
- Review submissions and viewer choices via **Cinema8 Analytics** to gain insights.
