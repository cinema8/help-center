# Adding Video Overlays

Video overlays are visual or interactive layers placed on top of your main video content. In Cinema8, you can use overlays to boost engagement, add context, promote actions, or reinforce your brandingâ€”without interrupting playback.

Overlays can be built using:
- **Widget Elements** â€“ for CTAs, info cards, lower thirds, etc.
- **Image Elements** â€“ for branding and static visuals
- **Video Elements** â€“ for embedded video segments, highlights, or effects
