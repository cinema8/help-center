Cinema8's Creative Studio empowers you to build interactive videos using a wide variety of **widgets** and **elements**. Whether you're enhancing product walkthroughs, generating leads, or building learning experiences, widgets bring interactivity and data capture into your video content.

## What Are Widgets and Elements?

Widgets are interactive components you can place on your video timeline. Each serves a distinct purposeâ€”some drive conversions, others collect feedback, or reinforce learning.

### Common Widget Types

- **Hotspots** â€“ Clickable areas that display tooltips, open links, or reveal extra content
- **Forms** â€“ Collect names, emails, or survey responses
- **Countdowns** â€“ Create urgency for sales, webinars, or product launches
- **Buttons** â€“ Guide viewers to next steps like visiting a page or signing up
- **Text Effects** â€“ Animate headings and labels for a polished experience

> ðŸŽ“ **Enterprise plans** also include quizzes, assessments, and advanced interactive widgets.
