## Tips for Effective Interactivity

<Callout type="info">
ðŸ§  Pro Tip: Start with one or two interactions per scene and place CTAs where attention is naturally highestâ€”like after a product reveal or just before the close.
</Callout>

- **Keep it focused** â€“ Too many elements can overwhelm users
- **Use logic** â€“ Place interactivity at key points of the viewer journey
- **Always test** â€“ Preview before publishing to catch layout or timing issues
