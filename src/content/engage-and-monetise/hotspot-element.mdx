# Hotspot Element

The **Hotspot Element** in Cinema8 allows you to create interactive points inside your videos to enhance viewer engagement. Whether you want to highlight a product, add contextual information, or guide users through a learning experience, hotspots are powerful tools that respond to user interaction.

## Types of Hotspots

- **Static Hotspots**  
  Stay fixed in one position on screen. Best for stable visuals like headers or buttons.

- **Sticky Hotspots**  
  Use motion tracking to follow a moving object. Ideal for product highlights or dynamic storytelling.
