## How to Use Templates on the Dashboard

<Steps>

### Step 1: Choose a Template

- Go to your **Cinema8 dashboard**.
- Browse the available templates under the **“Don’t know how to start?”** section or via the **“New Video”** option.
- Click on a template that fits your project needs (e.g. **“Increase Brand Visibility”**).
- Select **“Use this template”** to proceed.

### Step 2: Add Your Video Content

Once the template opens, start customizing it with your own media:

- **Option 1: Upload a New Video**  
  Use the **“Upload Video”** button to add a new file from your computer.

- **Option 2: Use an Existing Video**  
  Open your **Library** and select a previously uploaded video.

### Step 3: Customise Template Elements

Cinema8 templates come with interactive elements like text overlays, clickable hotspots, and animations. You can easily tailor these elements to your brand or purpose:

- **Drag and drop:** Move elements on the timeline to sync them with key video moments.
- **Edit content:** Click on any element (text, hotspots, CTAs) to adjust its content, style, or interactivity.
