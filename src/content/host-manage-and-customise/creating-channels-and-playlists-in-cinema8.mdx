# Creating Channels and Playlists in Cinema8

Cinema8 allows you to organise your video content into structured, branded environments using **channels** and **playlists**. Channels act as themed hubs for your content, while playlists help you group videos in a specific sequence or purpose.

This guide walks you through setting up both.
