# Organising Video Libraries

Cinema8 CMS helps you manage your video content with ease‚Äîwhether you're editing projects, publishing final videos, or storing raw footage. A well-organised library saves time, improves collaboration, and keeps your creative workflow running smoothly.

---

## Understanding the Library Structure

- **My Videos**  
  This section includes all videos you've worked on‚Äîedited, enhanced with interactivity, or prepared for publishing. It's your main workspace for content that's audience-ready.

- **Library**  
  This is where your raw video assets live. It includes screen recordings, uploads, and unedited files you may want to reuse or repurpose in future projects.
