# Brand Your Platform: White Labelling, Custom Domains, and CNAME Explained

Cinema8 gives you the tools to fully brand your platform and deliver a seamless experience to your users. Whether you're customizing your subdomain, applying your brand assets, or enabling private white labelling, this guide walks you through the key options.

---

## 1. Set Up a Custom Domain or Subdomain

You can serve your Cinema8 platform under your own domain or subdomain (e.g. `video.yourcompany.com`) using **CNAME records**.

### ‚úÖ How to Configure Your CNAME

1. Log in to your domain provider (e.g. GoDaddy, Cloudflare).
2. Go to **DNS Settings** for your domain.
3. Create a **CNAME record** pointing to your Cinema8 subdomain:
   - **Host/Name**: e.g. `video` (for `video.yourdomain.com`)
   - **Type**: `CNAME`
   - **Value**: `yourcompany.cinema8.com` *(provided in your Cinema8 dashboard)*

4. Save changes and wait for propagation (can take up to 24 hours).
5. Let the Cinema8 team know once setup is complete to verify the domain.
