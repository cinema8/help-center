# Creating Private or Password-Protected Videos

Cinema8 allows you to control who can access your videos through a set of flexible privacy options. You can choose to make a video public, restrict it with a password, or even limit access to specific domains for internal-only use.

- From the dropdown menu, choose **Adjust Privacy** to open the privacy settings modal.

### Step 3: Choose Your Privacy Level

- **Public** ‚Äî Anyone with the link can watch.
