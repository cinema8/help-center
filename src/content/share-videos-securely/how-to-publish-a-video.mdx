# How to Publish a Video

Cinema8 allows you to publish interactive videos with advanced privacy and sharing options, giving you complete control over who can access your content and how it’s distributed.

## Step 1: Finalise Your Video Content

- Open your video in **Cinema8 Creative Studio**.
- Ensure that all edits, interactions, and design elements are complete:
  - **Hotspots, forms, and logic paths** should be configured correctly.
  - Use **Preview Mode** to test the video as a viewer.
- Use quick tools to add:
  - Subtitles
  - Chapters
  - Team collaboration access

## Step 2: Publish the Video

- Click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner.
- Once published, the video will display a **“Published”** status on your dashboard.
- You can still make edits to published videos—changes apply immediately without unpublishing.

## Step 3: Configure Privacy Settings

- Open the **Privacy Settings** panel after publishing.
- Select your desired privacy level:
  - **Public** – Anyone with the link can access the video.
  - **Private** – Restrict access to authorised users.

Private video options include:

- **Password Protection** – Require a password for access.
- **Domain Restriction** – Limit playback to specific domains.

## Step 4: Enable Sharing Options

After publishing, use one or more of Cinema8’s sharing methods:

- **Embed Code** – Add the video to your website using HTML embed.
- **Social Sharing** – Share directly on platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, or X.
- **Personalised Links** – Generate unique, time-limited, trackable URLs.
- **SCORM Export** – Download as a SCORM package for LMS platforms such as Moodle or Blackboard.

## Step 5: Monitor Video Performance

Track how your video performs using **Cinema8 Analytics**:

- **Engagement metrics** – See how viewers interact with elements like CTAs, quizzes, and branching.
- **Completions and drop-offs** – Measure how far viewers make it into the video.
- **Viewer feedback** – Enable comments to collect insights directly from your audience.

Cinema8 ensures that your published video is not only accessible and secure but also continuously optimised through real-time analytics and flexible updates.
