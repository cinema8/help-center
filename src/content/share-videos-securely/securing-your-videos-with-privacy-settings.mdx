# Securing Your Videos with Privacy Settings

Cinema8 offers advanced privacy settings to help you safeguard your video content. Whether you're sharing internal training, premium content, or sensitive information, you can control exactly who can view your videos and how they are accessed.

## Configuring Privacy Settings

### Step 1: Open the Privacy Settings

- Open your video project in **Cinema8 Creative Studio**.
- Click the **Share** button in the top-right corner.
- Go to the **Privacy Settings** tab.

### Step 2: Choose Your Privacy Options

#### Set Access Level

- **Public** – Accessible to anyone; ideal for marketing or promotional videos.
- **Unlisted** – Not publicly searchable; only accessible with the direct link.

#### Enable Password Protection

- Check **Password Protected**.
- Enter a secure password that viewers must provide before watching.

#### Restrict by Domain

- Check **Domain Restricted**.
- Add one or more allowed domains (each on a new line) to prevent embedding on unauthorized sites.

#### Use Personalised Links

- Generate custom, time-limited links for specific viewers via the **Personalised Link** feature.
- Configure options like expiration time, viewer identity, and max playback duration.

## Additional Security Features

- **Non-downloadable playback** – All Cinema8 streamed videos are protected from downloading by default.
- **One-time access links** – Limit link usage to a single view per user.
- **Analytics and tracking** – Monitor access, viewer location, engagement, and completion rates.

## Tips for Secure Video Sharing

- Test all privacy settings before sending links externally.
- Combine domain restriction with password protection or time-limited links for sensitive content.
- Periodically check **Analytics** to verify usage patterns and detect suspicious access.
- For premium videos, always use personalised links and restrict domains to trusted environments.

Cinema8 ensures your content is securely delivered while maintaining maximum flexibility for your sharing and publishing needs.
