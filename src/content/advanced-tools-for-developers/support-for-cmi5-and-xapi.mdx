# Support for CMI5 and xAPI

## Learning Standard Integrations in Cinema8

Cinema8 currently provides strong support for industry-standard learning specifications:

### âœ… SCORM Support

Cinema8 supports:

- **SCORM 1.2**
- **SCORM 2004** (All editions)

To learn more about exporting SCORM-compatible packages from Cinema8 for use in your LMS, see:

ðŸ‘‰ [SCORM-Compatible Exports for LMS](/integrations-and-third-party-platforms/scorm-compatible-exports-for-lms)

### âœ… xAPI Integration

While native **cmi5** support is currently under development, **xAPI integration** is already possible using the [Cinema8 Widget Development Environment](/advanced-tools-for-developers/widget-api).

You can send xAPI statements from within a widget using custom JavaScript and connect to your LRS (Learning Record Store).

> If you need help setting up an xAPI integration or want a tailored solution, please [contact our team](https://cinema8.com/contact-us).
