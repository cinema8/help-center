# Authentication & SSO

## Implementing Authentication and Single Sign-On (SSO) in Cinema8

By default, Cinema8 videos play anonymously. In this mode, all viewer interactions are tracked under an anonymous identity.

If you'd like to track known users (e.g. from your intranet, LMS, mobile app, or SSO system), you can use the **Cinema8 Data API** to authenticate users via the `loginAsWithUsername` method and pass a valid token to the player.

<Callout type="warning">
This method allows secure "on behalf of" authentication. It’s your responsibility to ensure user tokens are securely generated and not exposed client-side.
</Callout>

## How to Authenticate a User

<Steps>

### Step 1: Generate the Token with `loginAsWithUsername`

Send a POST request to the following endpoint:

```http filename="login-as.txt"
POST https://cinema8.com/api/v1/authenticate/loginAsWithUsername/bearer
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

**Payload:**

```txt
token=YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN
username=accountname\\username
```

- `token`: Your admin token from the Cinema8 Token Console  
- `username`: The target username, including account name (e.g., `myaccount\\johndoe`)

**Success Response:**  
`200 OK` — returns an `authToken` valid for 6 hours  
**Error Response:**  
`401 Unauthorized` — user not found in the system

<Callout type="info">
If the user doesn’t exist yet, create the user using the Cinema8 Data API before calling this method.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Pass the Token to the Player

Once you have the token, pass it into the `authToken` field of your JS Player config:

```js filename="player-auth-token.js" showLineNumbers
var player = new Cinema8Player("#video", {
  id: "YVX3wMX4",
  style: "position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;",
  authToken: "YOUR_GENERATED_TOKEN",
  onready: function () {
    console.log("onready fired");
  },
  onplay: function () {
    console.log("onplay fired");
  },
  onpause: function () {
    console.log("onpause fired");
  },
  onprogress: function () {
    console.log("onprogress fired");
  },
  onend: function () {
    console.log("onend fired");
  }
});
```

</Steps>

## Best Practices

- Store tokens in a cache or map with a 6-hour expiration policy
- Always use HTTPS when transmitting tokens
- Do not expose admin tokens to frontend clients
- Use token rotation if building long-running or sensitive sessions

<Callout type="important">
All tracking and reporting in Cinema8 becomes user-specific once a valid token is used. This enables detailed analytics and personalization.
